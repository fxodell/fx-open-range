## Conclusion

### Long-Term Results Are Much More Realistic

The 5-year test shows:
- ✅ Strategy is profitable and consistent
- ✅ Win rate is high (82%) but not perfect (100%)
- ✅ Drawdown exists (83.88 pips) but is manageable
- ✅ Some losses occur (17.9%) but are controlled
- ✅ Performance is sustainable over long periods

### Comparison to 23-Day Sample

The 23-day sample showed **perfect results** (100% win rate, 0 drawdown) because:
- Very small sample size
- Favorable market conditions
- Strong uptrend period
- Not representative of longer-term performance

The 5-year results show **realistic performance**:
- Much larger sample (1,299 trades vs 22)
- Various market conditions
- Some losses and drawdown
- Sustainable long-term performance

### Bottom Line

**The strategy works well over 5 years:**
- +7,946 total pips
- 82% win rate
- 83.88 pip drawdown (very manageable)
- 16.97 profit factor (excellent)

**This is realistic, sustainable performance** - much better than the "too good to be true" 23-day results, but still very strong.
